# StubenBot

This is a Discord bot that does amazing things like offering a way to send stickers like on whatsapp.
I am aware that recently this feature got added by discord natively, this bot predates that time.
Still, as far as i know, stickers are limited and Nitro exclusive, so I guess all that work wasn't _completely_ useless :')

### How to use

1. Get the jar file from the releases page
2. Get a bot token from the Discord Developer Portal
3. In your folder, create a .env file with the following content:

```env
MAIN_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

4. Copy the folders `stickers` and `local` to the same folder as the jar file. Clear the files in them of any content.
5. Run the jar file with `java -jar StubenBot.jar --prod`
